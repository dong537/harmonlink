## Overview

<!--
Document your project's quality standards here.

Questions to answer:
- What patterns are forbidden?
- What linting rules do you enforce?
- What are your testing requirements?
- What code review standards apply?

(To be filled by the team)

---

## Forbidden Patterns

- Calling `fetch` directly in features — use `apiRequest`/`userApiRequest`.
- Optimistically mutating server state in local variables (e.g.
  `row.status = 'REFUNDED'`) instead of invalidating and re-reading.
- Hardcoded user-visible strings — all copy goes through `t(key)` with keys in
  `shared/i18n/{zh,en}.ts`.
- Decoding the opaque `admin_token`/`user_token` as a JWT to infer role.
- `any` in feature code (see `type-safety.md` for the single sanctioned router
  exception).
- Hiding a button as the *only* permission enforcement — the backend is the
  authority; UI hiding is UX only.
- Building UI for an endpoint a role cannot actually call. Before adding a
  button/page/menu entry for a given role, verify the backend use-case permits
  that role. If the endpoint is `@RequireUser` (or 403s for the current role),
  do **not** render the control for that role — a button that always fails is
  fake UI. Examples: admin must not get proxy lifecycle buttons (renew /
  change-password / switch-ip / export are USER-only); the admin API-key page is
  TENANT_ADMIN-only because list/create 403 for PLATFORM_ADMIN.
- Setting both `id` and `path` on a TanStack Router route.

---

## Required Patterns

- Server reads/writes via TanStack Query (`useQuery`/`useMutation`) over
  `apiRequest`; invalidate affected query keys on mutation success.
- Loading, error, and permission states must be visible — use `ListPage` (which
  renders `Skeleton` / `Alert` / permission warning) or the equivalent inline
  `Skeleton` + `Alert` pattern. Never render an empty table in place of an error.
- Surface backend `ApiError.reasonKey` to the user on failure.
- Pricing admin surfaces must format known backend pricing reasons through
  `features/pricing/pricing-errors.ts` and `pricing.reason.*` i18n keys. Unknown
  internal errors fall back to `pricing.reason.generic`; do not show raw strings
  such as `unit_price_invalid`, resource ids plus reason keys, or local contract
  diagnostics as the primary user-facing error.
- Thin route files; logic in feature components (see `directory-structure.md`).
- Role/tenant context from `useCurrentAdmin()` / `/api/auth/me`.
- Railway production frontend should call the same-origin `/api` proxy via the
  shared API client. Do not point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at the backend service
  URL in production; keep deployment docs and `buildApiUrl(...)` aligned so the
  browser never needs to reach the backend origin directly.
- Railway production frontend must keep the browser on same-origin `/api`
  while the web server proxy uses `WEB_API_PROXY_TARGET`; `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
  is not the server proxy target and must not be treated as one.
- Money display that uses the plain `amount currencyCode` shape must go through
  `shared/money/formatMoneyAmount(...)` instead of reimplementing parsing in a
  feature. The helper treats blank strings as missing values so UI does not
  accidentally render an unknown amount as `0.00 CNY`.
- Date-time table/detail display must go through `shared/time/formatDateTime(...)`
  instead of inline `new Date(value).toLocaleString()`. The helper keeps invalid
  upstream values visible as their raw string rather than rendering `Invalid Date`.

---

## Scenario: Bodyless API Requests Through the Web Proxy

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing `shared/api/client.ts`, `apps/web/serve.mjs`, or any admin/customer action that sends a bodyless API mutation such as provider health checks.
- Applies to browser requests through same-origin `/api` and the Node web proxy forwarding to the backend service.

### 2. Signatures

- Client call: `apiRequest<T>(path, { method: 'POST' })` or `userApiRequest<T>(path, { method: 'POST' })`.
- Proxy entry: `proxyApi(req, res, targetBase)` in `apps/web/serve.mjs`.
- Header sanitizer: `sanitizeProxyRequestHeaders(headers, bodyLength)`.
- Important routes: `POST /api/providers/:id/health-check`, `POST /api/upstream-accounts/:id/test`, and other bodyless probe endpoints.

### 3. Contracts

- `withJsonAuthHeaders(...)` must add `Content-Type: application/json` only when `RequestInit.body` is present.
- Explicit caller headers still win, but the shared client must not invent a JSON content type for bodyless `GET`, `POST`, or `DELETE` requests.
- The web proxy must remove `content-type` when the forwarded request body length is `0`, because stale browser bundles or external clients may still send `Content-Type: application/json` without a JSON body.
- Bodyful JSON mutations must keep `Content-Type: application/json` so backend DTO parsing remains stable.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Bodyless POST + stale `Content-Type: application/json` -> proxy strips the header, backend returns the real auth/probe result, not a JSON parser 500.
- Bodyless POST without auth -> `AUTH_REQUIRED` envelope, not `INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- Bodyful POST with JSON body -> header preserved and backend receives the payload.
- Network/proxy failure -> visible `network_error` / proxy failure, not fake success.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: provider health check calls `apiRequest('/api/providers/<id>/health-check', { method: 'POST' })` and sends only authorization headers.
- Base: create/update provider calls include `body: JSON.stringify(...)` and keep JSON content type.
- Bad: setting `Content-Type: application/json` globally for every request.
- Bad: proxying an empty request body while preserving stale `content-type`, which lets Fastify parse an empty JSON document before auth/use-case code runs.

### 6. Tests Required

- `src/shared/api/client.spec.ts`: bodyless POST does not include JSON content type; bodyful POST still does.
- `apps/web/serve.spec.mjs`: `sanitizeProxyRequestHeaders(...)` strips `content-type` when `bodyLength === 0` and preserves it when `bodyLength > 0`.
- Production smoke after deploy: `POST /api/providers/:id/health-check` with stale JSON content type and no auth must return `401 AUTH_REQUIRED`, not `500`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```ts
const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  ...init.headers,
};
```

Correct:

```ts
const headers = {
  ...(init.body !== undefined && init.body !== null ? { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } : {}),
  ...init.headers,
};
```

## Scenario: Customer Buy Pagination and Quote Reset

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: customer purchase page pagination, search filtering, and resource
  selection changes.
- Applies to the buy page resource list, country/region automatic assignment,
  and the order summary quote panel.

### 2. Signatures

- Country summary query: `GET /api/resources/countries?durationDays=30&currency=<walletCurrency>&search=<term>`.
- Resource list query: `GET /api/resources?page=<n>&pageSize=20&durationDays=30&currency=<walletCurrency>&countryCode=<CC>&search=<term>`.
- Resource list query key includes `currency`, `durationDays`, `search`,
  selected `countryCode`, and `pageNumber`.
- Page size for customer resource loading is fixed at 20.
- Quote state is derived from the auto-assigned current resource and quantity
  only.

### 3. Contracts

- When the customer changes resource page/search/currency, stale quote and
  selection state must be cleared before the next page is treated as current.
- `keepPreviousData` / placeholder data may be used for fetch continuity, but
  the page must not render previous-page results as if they were current.
- The visible buy price must come from the current page resource or the fresh
  quote for the current selection, not from an older page token.
- The current quote is keyed by the selected resource snapshot as well as
  `resourceId/quantity/currency`. If the selected row's unit price, currency,
  stock, stale-inventory flag, visibility, saleable flag, or status changes
  after a query invalidation, clear the old quote and request a new one.
- The country selector is backed by `/api/resources/countries`; it must not be
  derived from the current `/api/resources` page because that page is scoped to
  one country and one pagination window.
- Duplicate country summaries must be merged before rendering option cards so
  React keys and selected-country state stay stable.
- The customer UI must not render line/network/SKU card selectors. Resource ids
  may remain copyable for support, but the primary flow is country/region plus
  automatic assignment.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Page token changes -> clear selected region/resource and quote/loading
  state.
- Current selected resource changes price/stock/saleable snapshot after
  `['resources-list']` or `['resources-countries']` refresh -> clear stale quote
  and re-quote before enabling purchase again.
- Placeholder data while the next page loads -> keep the old request alive, but
  do not expose it as the current page contents.
- Deep pagination or a page number above the current page count -> clamp to the
  last valid page.
- Country search changes -> re-read country summaries, reset selected country
  and resource page, then load the first page for the new selected country.
- `/api/resources/countries` failure -> show a visible country-list error; do
  not fall back to an empty country grid.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: clicking page 2 clears the old quote and waits for the new resource
  page before rendering cards.
- Good: invalidating the current resource list after an admin price change
  triggers a second quote request and updates the buy summary to the new price.
- Good: the first screen can show all available countries from
  `/api/resources/countries` while the SKU grid only loads page 1 for the
  selected country.
- Base: page 1 loads normally and selected resource quoting works.
- Bad: using `/api/resources?page=1` as the country list, which hides countries
  that do not happen to appear on the first resource page.
- Bad: the next page briefly shows previous-page cards and quote values as if
  they belonged to the current page.
- Bad: stale `quoteLoading` / `quoteRefreshing` status survives after the user
  changes pages.

### 6. Tests Required

- Customer buy flow test covering page change after a quote selection.
- Customer buy flow test covering search-driven resource page reset.
- Customer buy flow test asserting country summaries are requested from
  `/api/resources/countries` and SKU pages include `countryCode`.
- Customer buy flow test invalidates the selected resource list after a price
  change and asserts a second quote request plus the refreshed total.
- Regression test for duplicate same-country upstream rows rendering one country
  card and preserving unique resource card keys by `resource.id`.
- Regression test asserting the customer buy page does not render the old
  `ipx-buy-network-card` selector or "network 1 / network 2" copy.
- Assertion points: no stale loading tag, no stale quote display, confirm
  disabled until the new current selection is ready.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const resources = resourcePage?.items ?? [];
const countryGroups = groupResourcesByCountry(resources);
```

#### Correct

```ts
const countryGroups = groupCountrySummaries(countriesQuery.data?.items ?? []);
const resources = resourcePageIsStale ? [] : resourcePage?.items ?? [];
```

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Vitest + Testing Library** for feature behavior: validation, API error
  surfacing, permission/error states, and that mutations hit the real endpoints
  and invalidate the right queries.
- Component tests for tenant-scoped tables must assert `tenantId` appears in the
  API query string.
- **Playwright** smoke tests run against the production bundle for critical flows
  (admin login/list, unauth redirect, customer login/wallet/top-up).
- Regression: existing single-row / filter / export tests must keep passing when
  adding batch or new operations.

---

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No direct `fetch`; all I/O via `apiRequest`/`userApiRequest`.
- [ ] All user-facing strings via `t(key)`, keys added to both `zh.ts` and `en.ts`.
- [ ] Mutations invalidate the correct query keys; no optimistic server-state edits.
- [ ] Loading/error/permission states are visible, not empty UI.
- [ ] Role guards in `router.tsx` `beforeLoad` match the menu visibility in
      `_layout.tsx`.
- [ ] New feature has co-located tests under `tests/`.
- [ ] No `any`; local DTOs typed; backend `reasonKey` surfaced on error.

## Scenario: Production Preview SPA Fallback

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: E2E smoke tests or local browser checks use `e2e/start-web.cjs` to serve `apps/web/dist`.

### 2. Signatures

- Preview server path: `e2e/start-web.cjs`.
- API proxy rule: only `/api` and `/api/...` proxy to `WEB_API_PROXY_TARGET`.
- SPA fallback candidates: `/`, requests with `Accept: text/html`, or URL paths with no file extension such as `/buy`, `/wallet`, `/api-keys`.

### 3. Contracts

- Customer/admin/public client routes must return `index.html` from the preview server even when the request does not explicitly send `Accept: text/html`.
- Static asset paths with file extensions must keep real 404 behavior when the file is missing.
- `/api-keys` is a frontend route and must not be treated as an API proxy path.
- `/api` and `/api/...` remain the only API proxy prefixes.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `GET /buy` with default PowerShell or curl-like headers -> `200 index.html`.
- `GET /api-keys` -> `200 index.html`, not `502` from the API proxy.
- `GET /assets/missing.js` -> `404`, not `index.html`.
- `GET /api/resources` -> proxied to backend target.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:4173/buy` returns 200 before a Playwright smoke.
- Base: browser navigation with `Accept: text/html` keeps working.
- Bad: matching `pathname.startsWith('/api')`, which accidentally proxies `/api-keys`.
- Bad: falling back to `index.html` for every missing asset, hiding broken bundle references.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `node --test e2e/start-web.test.cjs` after changing preview proxy or SPA fallback logic.
- Smoke check the preview server with a non-browser request to an extensionless route.
- Browser smoke should still verify page title/text for the same route.
- If adding automated coverage, assert `/assets/missing.js` still returns 404.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```js
if (url.pathname.startsWith('/api')) proxyApi(req, res, url);
```

Correct:

```js
if (url.pathname === '/api' || url.pathname.startsWith('/api/')) proxyApi(req, res, url);
```

## Scenario: Frontend Initial Load Budget

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing top-level routes, route layouts, global CSS, i18n bootstrapping, or Vite chunk configuration.
- Applies to `apps/web/src/app/router.tsx`, `apps/web/src/main.tsx`, `apps/web/src/shared/theme/*.css`, `apps/web/src/shared/i18n/index.ts`, `apps/web/index.html`, and `apps/web/vite.config.ts`.

### 2. Signatures

- Route component signature: `component: lazyPage(() => import('../routes/<area>/<page>'), '<ExportName>')`.
- Entry CSS signature: `main.tsx` imports only `./shared/theme/base.css`.
- Authenticated shell CSS signature: `routes/admin/_layout.tsx` and `routes/customer/_layout.tsx` import `../../shared/theme/tokens.css`.
- Runtime i18n bootstrap: `resources` contains the active language only unless a runtime language switch is implemented.

### 3. Contracts

- Public pages, login/register pages, admin/customer layouts, and content-heavy pages must not be statically imported by `router.tsx`.
- `tokens.css` is the authenticated shell/theme stylesheet and must not be imported by `main.tsx`.
- `base.css` contains only variables and browser reset required before any route chunk loads.
- `index.html` must not load external font stylesheets for the default Chinese deployment; use system font stacks to avoid blocking first paint.
- Vite manual chunks must not force all of `antd` or `@ant-design/icons` into a chunk required by the initial entry.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `router.tsx` statically imports a route page/layout -> initial JS grows and the route must be converted to `lazyPage`.
- `main.tsx` imports `tokens.css` -> public/auth routes download authenticated shell CSS; move that import back to authenticated layouts.
- `index.html` or CSS imports Google Fonts -> default deployment waits on a remote font endpoint; remove the external font link/import.
- `vite.config.ts` groups `antd` and `@ant-design/icons` as a mandatory vendor chunk -> Ant Design code needed only by lazy routes can be pulled into first load.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `/` initial HTML preloads only the main entry, `vendor-tanstack`, and a tiny `index-*.css`.
- Good: admin/customer navigation loads `tokens-*.css` with the authenticated layout chunk.
- Base: public route CSS such as `home.css` and `buy.css` remains route-local.
- Bad: importing `PublicHomePage`, `AdminLayout`, or `CustomerLayout` directly in `router.tsx`.
- Bad: adding `@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/...")` to global CSS.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `pnpm --filter @ipeasy/web typecheck`.
- Run `pnpm --filter @ipeasy/web lint`.
- Run a clean `pnpm --filter @ipeasy/web build` and inspect `dist/index.html` plus gzip size output.
- Run `node --test e2e/start-web.test.cjs` after changing production preview routing or static asset behavior.
- For changed i18n bootstrap, run the shared i18n copy tests.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```tsx
import { PublicHomePage } from '../routes/public/home';

createRoute({ path: '/', component: PublicHomePage });
```

Correct:

```tsx
const publicHomePage = lazyPage(() => import('../routes/public/home'), 'PublicHomePage');

createRoute({ path: '/', component: publicHomePage });
```

Wrong:

```ts
import './shared/theme/tokens.css';
```

Correct:

```ts
import './shared/theme/base.css';
```

## Scenario: Admin Provider Inventory Sync Failure UI

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: Admin provider/resource pages call the inventory sync endpoint, especially from provider health/resource setup actions and resource row actions.
- Applies to provider sync mutations, resource row sync mutations, and tests under `features/admin-providers` / `features/admin-resources`.

### 2. Signatures

- Provider sync path: `POST /api/resources/sync-inventory`.
- Resource row sync path: `POST /api/resources/:id/sync-inventory`.
- Successful sync response: `{ attempted, created, updated, skipped, failed, synced, syncedAt, upstreamRawStatus, countries }`.
- Backend failure shape: `ApiError` with `reasonKey`, for example `inventory_empty` or upstream-specific failures.

### 3. Contracts

- Sync failures must derive their failure state from `ApiError.reasonKey`, but
  the provider UI must render a localized `providers.reason.*` / related i18n
  message instead of showing raw machine keys such as `inventory_empty` as the
  primary copy.
- A failed sync must not render the success result block or imply that upstream resources were synced.
- Frontend sync mutations must type the full successful response shape. Do not normalize legacy count-only responses such as `{ synced }` into a successful audit summary.
- Successful sync may invalidate provider/resource/pricing queries, but failure keeps current server state unchanged and visible.
- User-visible labels come from i18n. Unknown backend `reasonKey` values fall
  back to a localized generic provider failure message; raw keys belong in logs
  or debugging details, not the main provider card/drawer/toast copy.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Backend returns `inventory_empty` -> show the localized provider reason, do not show sync success summary, and do not expose the raw key as primary copy.
- Backend/network failure -> show the localized derived reason, do not clear the provider row.
- Successful provider sync -> show the sync result and invalidate affected server-state queries.
- Successful resource row sync -> show counts and countries from the backend response; missing fields are a contract failure, not values to invent in the UI.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: PR sync returns zero items and the page shows the localized "upstream returned no available inventory" reason instead of a green success notice or the raw `inventory_empty` key.
- Good: resource row sync displays `attempted/synced/skipped/countries` from the API response.
- Base: connectivity test and inventory sync have separate visible error slots per provider.
- Bad: catching sync failure and leaving the previous success result visible.
- Bad: treating an empty upstream inventory as an empty successful resource list.
- Bad: converting `{ synced: 1 }` into `{ attempted: 1, updated: 1, countries: [] }`, which hides a stale backend contract.

### 6. Tests Required

- Component test: sync endpoint rejection displays the localized reason derived from `reasonKey` and asserts the raw key is not the primary visible copy.
- Component test: sync endpoint rejection does not render the success result.
- Component test: resource row sync mock uses the full auditable response shape and the UI reads that shape directly.
- Regression: successful sync still renders the sync result and invalidates provider/resource state.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```tsx
onError: () => setSyncResult({ synced: 0 });
```

Wrong:

```tsx
const result = {
  attempted: data.attempted ?? data.synced,
  countries: Array.isArray(data.countries) ? data.countries : [],
};
```

This turns an obsolete response contract into a fake successful audit summary.

Correct:

```tsx
onError: (error) => {
  const reason = getReasonKey(error);
  setActionErrors((prev) => ({ ...prev, [provider.id]: reason }));
};
```

Correct:

```tsx
apiRequest<SyncInventoryResult>(`/api/resources/${resourceId}/sync-inventory`, { method: 'POST' });
```

## Scenario: Forms, Route Guards, and Browser Smoke Tests

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: login, wallet, and top-up flows depend on React Hook Form, Ant Design, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, and backend error envelopes.

### 2. Signatures

- Login fields: `email`, `password`.
- Top-up fields: `amount`, `channel`.
- Stable E2E submit selector: `button[type="submit"]` when Ant Design spacing changes short Chinese accessible names.

### 3. Contracts

- Ant Design inputs participating in schema validation must be wired through React Hook Form `Controller`.
- `InputNumber` must not rely on `min` as the business validation source of truth; `0` and negative values must reach Zod/RHF and block submit.
- Frontend API/permission failures must render visible errors, not zero balances or empty data.
- TanStack Router routes must not set both `id` and `path`. Use `path` for URL routes and `id` only for pathless layout routes.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Invalid email -> validation error and no API call.
- Empty password -> validation error and no API call.
- Login `AUTH_REQUIRED`/`invalid_credentials` -> invalid credentials copy, no crash.
- Network failure -> generic network error copy, no crash.
- Top-up `amount <= 0` -> validation error and no `/api/payments` call.
- Wallet `PERMISSION_DENIED` or API 500 -> visible alert, not empty wallet.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: tests fill real inputs, submit the form, and assert API call counts plus visible copy.
- Good: E2E waits for login navigation before entering guarded customer routes.
- Base: route guard tests assert unauthenticated admin users redirect to `/admin/login`.
- Bad: `min={0.01}` silently coerces invalid amounts before schema validation sees them.
- Bad: Playwright locks to `getByRole('button', { name: '登录' })` when Ant Design exposes spaced text.

### 6. Tests Required

- Vitest + Testing Library for login validation, API errors, wallet permission/API errors, and top-up invalid amounts.
- Playwright smoke against the production bundle for Admin login/list, Admin unauth redirect, Customer login/wallet, and Customer top-up.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```tsx
<InputNumber min={0.01} />
```

#### Correct

```tsx
<Controller
  name="amount"
  control={control}
  render={({ field }) => <InputNumber {...field} precision={2} />}
/>
```

## Scenario: Admin Route Transition Responsiveness

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: admin and customer shells wrap page content during navigation.
- Applies to `shared/ui/route-transition.tsx`, admin/customer layouts, and any route wrapper that changes the rendered page key.

### 2. Signatures

- Wrapper: `<RouteTransition routeKey={location.pathname}>...`

### 3. Contracts

- Route changes should render immediately. Do not introduce a fixed post-navigation timer just to keep a busy overlay visible.
- If a loading state is needed, it must reflect actual pending router or data work, not an artificial delay.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Navigation completes instantly -> no extra busy state remains visible.
- Real data query still pending -> show the query's own loading/error state, not a fake timer-based state.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: clicking a sidebar item swaps content without waiting on a hardcoded animation timer.
- Base: a route change may still feel progressive if a real query or lazy chunk is loading.
- Bad: holding the previous page for a fixed 360ms after every route key change.

### 6. Tests Required

- Wrapper test: route key change remounts content without requiring a timer-driven navigation flag.
- Browser smoke: menu navigation still works while content swaps immediately.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```tsx
window.setTimeout(() => setIsNavigating(false), 360);
```

#### Correct

```tsx
<div key={routeKey}>{children}</div>
```

The router and data layer own loading; the wrapper should not add an artificial pause.

## Scenario: Legacy Frontend Same-Origin API Compatibility

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: deploying a previously built frontend bundle whose API paths or auth
  response shape differ from the current backend contract.
- Applies to the Zeabur static web service, its Nginx `/api` proxy, and the
  legacy bundle's auth/customer adapters.

### 2. Signatures

- Browser API base: same-origin `/api`.
- Auth endpoints: `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/register`.
- Auth response: `{ code, msg, data: { token, expiresAt }, requestId }`.
- Public site context: `GET /api/sites/current` with `x-public-host` forwarded.

### 3. Contracts

- The browser must never call the backend origin directly; Nginx owns the
  same-origin proxy and preserves `Authorization` and public-host headers.
- Legacy auth adapters must read `data.token` (and only boundedly accept the
  historical `access_token` alias) and persist the token before routing.
- Registration must submit the resolved `siteId`; a missing token is a visible
  registration failure, not a successful redirect.
- Optional legacy screens must not call unavailable endpoints during unrelated
  tabs. The dedicated manage tab may load only the real list contract and must
  render an explicit empty state when no lines exist.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Login/register response with `data.token` -> persist token and navigate to the
  authenticated route.
- Missing token or non-2xx response -> remain on auth page and show the backend
  error.
- Public host context request -> proxy forwards `x-public-host`; backend returns
  the matching site/tenant context.
- Manage tab without a dedicated list route -> no `/zones`, SKU, or location
  requests; render `暂无专线` (or the localized equivalent) without console errors.
- Backend/API proxy failure -> visible error; do not replace it with fake rows.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: browser requests remain under `/api`, login returns 201, and the user
  reaches `/dashboard` with no console errors.
- Base: a customer with no dedicated lines sees a real empty state.
- Bad: hardcoding the backend URL into the bundle or treating `{ data: { token } }`
  as a legacy top-level token response.
- Bad: loading purchase-only zones/SKUs/locations while opening manage, creating
  avoidable 404s and masking the actual list state.

### 6. Tests Required

- Playwright production smoke: register a new test customer and assert a 201
  registration plus navigation to `/dashboard`.
- Playwright production smoke: login, open dashboard and dedicated manage, and
  assert no API response >= 400 and no console/page errors.
- Static proxy check: assert the web service exposes `/api` same-origin and the
  backend origin is absent from browser requests.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```js
const token = response.access_token;
await loadZones(); // runs while the manage tab is opening
```

#### Correct

```js
const token = response.data?.token ?? response.access_token;
if (activeTab === 'buy') await loadPurchaseOptions();
```

## Scenario: Legacy Static Bundle API Adapters

### Scope / Trigger

When the deployed static bundle is updated without rebuilding the source app, its feature adapters must still match the current API controller contracts.

### Contracts

- Tickets create uses `POST /api/tickets` with `{ subject, body }`.
- Ticket replies use `POST /api/tickets/:id/messages` with `{ body }`; closing uses `POST /api/tickets/:id/close`.
- Ticket and payment list responses use `{ items, total, page, pageSize }`; adapters may project `items` to the bundle's legacy `data` field.
- Ticket ids are opaque strings and must not be coerced with `Number(...)`.
- Manual recharge requests use `POST /api/payments` with `channel: "MANUAL"` and an adapter-generated unique `idempotencyKey`; user-entered remittance proof is not part of the request.

### Validation & Error Matrix

- Legacy endpoint or field (`/reply`, `content`, `PATCH /close`) -> API 404/400; adapter must use the current route and DTO.
- UUID ticket route coerced to number -> request omitted or malformed; preserve the route param as a string.
- List response read from `data` only -> successful API response renders an empty table; map `items` explicitly.

### Tests Required

- Static bundle syntax checks for changed chunks.
- Browser smoke: recharge order navigation, no proof textarea, ticket create/detail navigation, dashboard CTA navigation.
- Network assertion: these flows produce no API 4xx and no browser console errors.
